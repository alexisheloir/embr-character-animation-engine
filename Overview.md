EMBR is a realtime character animation engine that offers a high degree of animation control via the EMBRScript language.

# Introduction #

Embodied agents are a powerful paradigm for current and future multimodal interfaces, yet require high effort and expertise for their creation, assembly and animation control. Therefore, open animation engines and high-level control languages are required to make embodied agents accessible to researchers and developers. In this paper, we present **EMBR**, a realtime character animation engine that offers a high degree of animation control via the **EMBRScript** language. We argue that a new layer of control, the _animation_ _layer_, is necessary to keep the higher-level control layers (behavioral/functional) consistent and slim, while allowing a unified and abstract access to the animation engine, e.g. for the procedural animation of nonverbal behavior.
